## Technologies

## Experience
- Svelte is a very interesting framework. 
- It is very easy to learn and use. I really like the way it handles state management.
- I also like the fact that it is very fast and lightweight. I will definitely use it again in the future.
- I started programming with react. So, I think svelte is a bit different from react. but not at all difficult to learn. Compared to vue, I think svelte is easier to learn.
